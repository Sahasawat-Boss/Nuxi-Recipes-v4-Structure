# Fetching Data

https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching

The need for useFetch and useAsyncData
Nuxt is a framework which can run isomorphic (or universal) code in both server and client environments. If the $fetch function is used to perform data fetching in the setup function of a Vue component, this may cause data to be fetched twice, once on the server (to render the HTML) and once again on the client (when the HTML is hydrated). This can cause hydration issues, increase the time to interactivity and cause unpredictable behavior.

The useFetch and useAsyncData composables solve this problem by ensuring that if an API call is made on the server, the data is forwarded to the client in the payload.

The payload is a JavaScript object accessible through useNuxtApp().payload. It is used on the client to avoid refetching the same data when the code is executed in the browser during hydration.
